VGGish_pytorch

Environment
This assignment is run under Google Colab environment. If not using Google Colab, please ignore the code blocks that with comments "run in Colab". The note book also uses GPU provided in Colab.

Directory
The notebook is put in Google drive base folder. Output data could also be found in the same directory. .dat data audio data can be found under the folder 'distribution/'. 

How to run the code
The code is organized in a top down fashion. Detailed instructions of how to run the notebook is included in the notebook.

A few important points to note:

1. The code block labeled with Load data should only be once. (also noted in the notebook)
2. While getting dataset objects for training, validation, testing sets, run either one of the code blocks in the section. (Either getting imbalanced data or balanced data)
